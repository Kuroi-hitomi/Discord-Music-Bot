Downloaded the npm/node(Node Package Manage), Downloaded the most of required packages except discordjs/opus

While trying to download the discordjs/opus, found a possibly solution on github. Which is use the command "npm install node-pre-gyp rebuild"

After running this command, the following error message shows up:

npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated osenv@0.1.5: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated rimraf@2.7.1: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated npmlog@4.1.2: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated are-we-there-yet@1.1.7: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated gauge@2.7.4: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated node-pre-gyp@0.17.0: Please upgrade to @mapbox/node-pre-gyp: the non-scoped node-pre-gyp package is deprecated and only the @mapbox scoped package will recieve updates in the future

After completed the installment of the above packages, retried the command nmp install discordjs/opus. Still won't work, but based on the error message, there's another thing we need to download from Visual Studio (Fully fledged IDE) which is "Desktop Development with C++"

2024/7/16 Music Bot Log 2

All dependencies downloaded, program development officially started.

imported discord.js, discord-player and ./config.json file to index.js file.

Created client, then the login part, once run that part of code. The status of music bot will become online and cmd will show the login message as we pre-written. 

Then design the discord players, don't know how that part works yet. 

Then added slash commands function, real-time detecting all members's sent message after the bot logged in. Once detected the command "!deploy", it will deploying the commands we designed for it in the code. If fail, error message will be showed in both cmd and discord text channel. Few things need to be noticed:
1. The naming rule for the command of the slash command
2. The naming rule for the option part (after the slash command part) 
3. console.log very useful, use it more frequently benefit for debugging

Before the bot actually execute the command, we need to make sure that the user satisfies all the conditions that is required for the bot to play music. (2 condition: User needs to be in the voice channel, User needs to be in the same voice channel with bot.) 

Implementing the play command:
